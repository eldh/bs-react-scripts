# bs-react-scripts

Scripts for using [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=bs-react-scripts
```

## Status

Experimental. Barely tested.

The plan is to provide a more opinionated set of Reason-specific tools, possibly removing some js-centric features.

## Contributions

Please report any issues, and suggest improvments.
