# bs-react-scripts

Scripts for using [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

```sh
npx create-react-app MyApp --scripts-version=bs-react-scripts
```

## ReasonReact or BsReact?

You will be prompted to choose which React bindings to install.

- [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) is the best choice for most people. It has great documentation and it's used in many production projects.
- [BsReact](https://github.com/eldh/bs-react/) works with new React features like Hooks, error boundaries and context. It's still under active development and documentation is currently non-existent.

## Status

Experimental. Barely tested.

The plan is to provide a more opinionated set of Reason-specific tools, possibly removing some js-centric features.

## Contributions

Please report any issues, and suggest improvments.
